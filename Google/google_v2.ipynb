According to the latest Monthly Report, this is largely due to a deterioration in the competitiveness of the German economy. More than three-quarters of the losses in market shares between 2021 and 2023 were the result of supply-side constraints. In this issue, the authors look at what is behind the decline in German export market shares and derive possible structural reforms.\\nWhat’s behind the sustained decline in German export market shares?\\n© aerial-drone / AdobeStock\\nJoachim Nagel: Target achieved, but challenges still remain\\n10.07.2025\\nMonetary policy must be reliable, but policymakers must not overly restrict its flexibility\\n, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said at the 10th Bundesbank\\nIAW\\nLecture in Tübingen.

Applicants and licensees of qualifying boards and programs will be charged an additional $5 fee. The fees will be used to establish a contingent litigation fund. The fund will help offset compliance costs for licensees of impacted boards. Fund participants are evaluated on a yearly basis and will be disclosed prior to July 1 of each year.

The change in approach affords public members the ability to take part in their government while balancing the board’s need to conduct its business in a timely fashion.\\nWhat are the primary changes?\\nAt the beginning of each meeting there is an opportunity for the public to comment on matters which are not on the current meeting agenda. The board cannot act on or discuss items not on the current agenda. The board may direct staff to put an issue brought forward from the public on a future meeting agenda.\\nThe public may comment on an agenda item during the public comment period for each board action item. Each meeting agenda will reflect this time after the introduction of a topic. If there is no public comment, the chair or presiding officer may immediately close that item’s public comment period and proceed with the meeting. The chair or presiding officer may limit comments to proceed with the meeting as well. Once the public comment period is closed, the public may not provide further comment during the remainder of the agenda item discussion, unless specifically requested by the chair or presiding officer of the meeting. Written public comments may be submitted and are encouraged.\\nHow do I submit my public comments?\\nPlease submit your written public comment(s), related to an agenda item, no later than seven (7) days prior to a scheduled board meeting. In your comments, please include your first and last name, and what organization you are representing, if you are representing one. Please also specify what agenda item you are commenting on, or if it is a general comment for consideration. Keep your comments direct and detail the issue(s) you want to bring to the board’s attention. Comments unrelated to an agenda item may be submitted at any time and are encouraged.\\nWritten comments can be submitted by email either to the board’s executive officer or board specific inbox. Contact information is located\\nhere\\n; simply navigate to the appropriate board and scroll to the bottom of the webpage where contact information for each officer and inbox is located. If you have further questions, please reach out to the executive officer of the board you are interested in.\\nPlease see the Public Comment Guide and FAQ below for more specific details:\\nPublic Comment Guide\\nPublic Comment FAQ\\nLicense Information\\nRegulations\\nStatute/Rule Information\\nAdministrative Rules\\nStatutes\\nRule Notices\\nForms\\nServices / Links\\nContinuing Education\\nFAQ\\nMilitary Spouses\\nMontana\\nBoard of Physical Therapy Examiners\\nMilitary Spouses\\nMilitary Spouse Application Information\\nThe Montana Department of Labor & Industry, Employment Standards Division, is committed to supporting and assisting military members and their spouses obtain professional and occupational licenses. We are dedicated to helping military families work and live in the great State of Montana.\\nTo support professionally licensed military families, please find detailed information about the professional licensing process in the state of Montana and some tips on how to get licensed quickly.\\nStart Early\\n6/10/22\\nStart your application early and online. Our online applications are the quickest way to apply, ebiz.mt.gov/pol. It may take some time for our Application processors to review your applications, documents, verifications, and license requirements. Applying before you move to Montana will help ensure all of the requirements for licensure are met and your license can be issued before you begin working in Montana.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nHave all records separated and available\\n6/10/22\\nKeep licensing, education, employment, and other records handy, do not pack them away for the move. If you are moving, be sure to keep your important documents in an easy and convenient spot. If you are wondering what documentation, information, or requirements are needed for your desired Montana license, go to the board website, click on Forms tab on the left, click Licensing Application, and select which license you would like to apply for. A document will have all application and licensing requirements needed. Please reference the image below to help guide you.\\nIt is important to note that every licensing board’s website might look a little different.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nUse an active and accessible email address\\n6/10/22\\nAfter you apply online, please be sure to use an active and convenient email address and watch your email for communication from your application processing team. Our team communicates via email. Whenever you fill out your application, please use an email address that is easily accessible and active for you. A quick response time will aid in a faster licensing process.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nPartner with our Customer Service Section for help\\n6/10/22\\nWe want to make sure that military spouses and families get the help and support that they need. Our customer service support staff is prepared to help you through your application and licensing process. If you need assistance, or have any questions please call 406-444-6880, or you can email customer service staff at\\nDLIBSDHELP@MT.GOV\\n. In your call or email, please make sure to tell our customer service representatives that you are a military spouse. They will ensure that you get the answers and assistance you need.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nDisclose ALL states you are licensed in\\n6/10/22\\nFinally, we know that license verifications can be a time-consuming process. When applicable, our application processing team will help verify out-of-state licenses via online verification portals, if the verifying state has the information available. Please be sure to list the states that you\\nalready have an active professional license in.\\nThat information will help our application processing team verify your licenses, when possible. However, we understand that not every state is set up for online license verifications and they will have to be sent in the mail or through a formal request.\\nIf all other licensing requirements are met,\\nwe can issue a provisional license with a reservation of rights. This acts as an active, full license for 60 days. This allows the licensee to get to work, while we complete the license verification process.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nContact Information\\n6/10/22\\nWe are looking forward to having you and your family in Montana!

It is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines, hence plays a key role in the physiology of adrenergic neurons. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive Segawa syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.

Some user-agents, such as screen readers, may present this description before the content itself.\\ncolspan\\nA non-negative integer value indicating how many columns the header cell spans or extends. The default value is\\n1\\n. User agents dismiss values higher than 1000 as incorrect, defaulting such values to\\n1\\n.\\nheaders\\nA list of space-separated strings corresponding to the\\nid\\nattributes of the\\n<th>\\nelements that provide the headers for this header cell.\\nrowspan\\nA non-negative integer value indicating how many rows the header cell spans or extends. The default value is\\n1\\n; if its value is set to\\n0\\n, the header cell will extend to the end of the table grouping section (\\n<thead>\\n,\\n<tbody>\\n,\\n<tfoot>\\n, even if implicitly defined), that the\\n<th>\\nbelongs to. Values higher than\\n65534\\nare clipped at\\n65534\\n.\\nscope\\nDefines the cells that the header (defined in the\\n<th>\\n) element relates to. Possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are:\\nrow\\n: the header relates to all cells of the row it belongs to;\\ncol\\n: the header relates to all cells of the column it belongs to;\\nrowgroup\\n: the header belongs to a rowgroup and relates to all of its cells;\\ncolgroup\\n: the header belongs to a colgroup and relates to all of its cells.\\nIf the\\nscope\\nattribute is not specified, or its value is not\\nrow\\n,\\ncol\\n,\\nrowgroup\\n, or\\ncolgroup\\n, then browsers automatically select the set of cells to which the header cell applies.\\nDeprecated attributes\\nThe following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.\\nalign\\nDeprecated\\nSpecifies the horizontal alignment of the header cell. The possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are\\nleft\\n,\\ncenter\\n,\\nright\\n,\\njustify\\n, and\\nchar\\n. When supported, the\\nchar\\nvalue aligns the textual content on the character defined in the\\nchar\\nattribute and the offset defined by the\\ncharoff\\nattribute. Use the\\ntext-align\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\naxis\\nDeprecated\\nContains a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to the\\nid\\nattribute of a group of cells that the header cell applies to. Use the\\nscope\\nattribute instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nbgcolor\\nDeprecated\\nDefines the background color of the header cell. The value is an HTML color; either a\\n6-digit hexadecimal RGB code\\n, prefixed by a\\n#\\n, or a\\ncolor keyword\\n. Other CSS\\n<color>\\nvalues are not supported. Use the\\nbackground-color\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nchar\\nDeprecated\\nDoes nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of the header cell. Typical values for this include a period (\\n.\\n) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If\\nalign\\nis not set to\\nchar\\n, this attribute is ignored.\\ncharoff\\nDeprecated\\nDoes nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the header cell content from the alignment character specified by the\\nchar\\nattribute.\\nheight\\nDeprecated\\nDefines a recommended header cell height. Use the\\nheight\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nvalign\\nDeprecated\\nSpecifies the vertical alignment of the header cell. The possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are\\nbaseline\\n,\\nbottom\\n,\\nmiddle\\n, and\\ntop\\n. Use the\\nvertical-align\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nwidth\\nDeprecated\\nDefines a recommended header cell width. Use the\\nwidth\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nUsage notes\\nThe\\n<th>\\nmay only be used within a\\n<tr>\\nelement.\\nIn simple contexts, using the\\nscope\\nattribute on header cells (\\n<th>\\nelements) is redundant because\\nscope\\nis inferred. However, certain assistive technologies may fail to infer correctly, so specifying header scope may improve user experiences.\\nWhen using the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes to span header cells across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes defined (with a default value of\\n1\\n) are automatically fitted into free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as illustrated in the following figure:\\nNote:\\nThese attributes must not be used to overlap cells.\\nExamples\\nSee\\n<table>\\nfor a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.\\nBasic column and row headers\\nThis example uses\\n<th>\\nelements to introduce column and row headers in a basic table structure.\\nHTML\\nThe first row (\\n<tr>\\nelement) contains the column headers (\\n<th>\\nelements), which act as \"titles\" for the columns to make it easier to understand the information in the columns and identify the data. To indicate that each column header relates to all cells in the corresponding column, the\\nscope\\nattribute is set to\\ncol\\n(column).\\nThe remaining rows contain the main data of the table. Each of these rows has a row header (\\n<th>\\nelement) introduced as the first cell. This creates a column with row headers as the first column of the table. Similar to the column headers, the\\nscope\\nattribute is set to\\nrow\\nto specify which cells each row header relates to, which in the example below are all data cells (\\n<td>\\nelements) in each\\nrow\\n.\\nNote:\\nNormally, the grouping elements\\n<thead>\\nand\\n<tbody>\\nare used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections.

In this way, the \"Pronunciation\" column is split into two columns, one for the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation and one for the respelling (the original pronunciation column). The corresponding data cells (\\n<td>\\nelements) are added to each subsequent row.\\nAs shown in the\\nusage notes\\n, the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes can be used for the\\n<th>\\nelements to allocate the header cells to the correct columns and rows. To achieve a \"two-row\" header in the table structure, the first two header cells within the first\\n<tr>\\nelement are spanned across two rows. The third header cell is spanned two columns wide (remaining in the first row). This setup leaves two available areas in the third and fourth columns in the second row, where the two headers within the second\\n<tr>\\nelement are automatically placed, with the default value being\\n1\\nfor the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes.\\nNote:\\nNormally,\\n<thead>\\nand\\n<tbody>\\nelements are used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections.

Therefore, the\\nheaders\\nattribute is used on the \"Pronunciation\", \"IPA\", and \"Respelling\" header cells to associate the related header cells based on the values of the unique identifiers from the added\\nid\\nattributes in the form of a space-separated list.\\nNote:\\nIt\\'s recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the\\nid\\nattribute.

I called Samsung at 800 726 7864 on my Google Voice on my Windows 11 Laptop\\xa0 and the helpful gentleman in the Dominican Republic said we need to get TMobile on the line.

After some minutes, after verifying my identity and using her system in SC, she had me go through the same exact menu and this time it was Unlocked.I thanked both of them in the Dominican Republic and in South Carolina and me being in New York.\\xa0 Now I have the option to try other MVNO offers on TMobile compatible or other networks.\\nI am amazed this multi-party, multi-country free Google Voice phone call over VOIP from my laptop also worked.\\nRead more\\nShare\\nShare\\nNew to Reddit?\\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\\nContinue with Email\\nContinue With Phone Number\\nBy continuing, you agree to our\\nUser Agreement\\nand acknowledge that you understand the\\nPrivacy Policy\\n.\\nPublic\\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\\nReddit Rules\\nPrivacy Policy\\nUser Agreement\\nAccessibility\\nReddit, Inc. © 2025.

All were established in 1945\\xa0when the UN was founded.\\nGeneral Assembly\\nThe General Assembly is the main deliberative,\\xa0policymaking and representative organ of the UN. All\\xa0193 Member States of the UN are represented in the\\xa0General Assembly, making it the only UN body with\\xa0universal representation.\\nSecurity Council\\nThe Security Council has primary responsibility, under\\xa0the UN Charter, for the maintenance of international\\xa0peace and security. It has 15 Members (5 permanent\\xa0and 10 non-permanent members). Each Member has\\xa0one vote. Under the Charter, all Member States are\\xa0obligated to comply with Council decisions.\\nEconomic and Social Council\\nThe Economic and Social Council is the principal body\\xa0for coordination, policy review, policy dialogue and\\xa0recommendations on economic, social and\\xa0environmental issues, as well as implementation of\\xa0internationally agreed development goals.\\nTrusteeship Council\\nThe Trusteeship Council was established in 1945 by the\\xa0UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international\\xa0supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed\\xa0under the administration of seven Member States, and\\xa0ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the\\xa0Territories for self-government and independence.\\nInternational Court of Justice\\nThe International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Its seat is at the Peace Palace in the Hague (Netherlands). It is the only one of the six principal organs of the United Nations not located in New York (United States of America).\\nSecretariat\\nThe Secretariat comprises the Secretary-General and\\xa0tens of thousands of international UN staff members\\xa0who carry out the day-to-day work of the UN as\\xa0mandated by the General Assembly and the\\xa0Organization\\'s other principal organs.\\nMore about the structure of the United Nations\\nLearn more\\nThe Essential UN\\nThe United Nations is the only place on Earth where all the world\\'s nations come together to discuss common problems and find shared solutions that benefit all of humanity.

According to the latest Monthly Report, this is largely due to a deterioration in the competitiveness of the German economy. More than three-quarters of the losses in market shares between 2021 and 2023 were the result of supply-side constraints. In this issue, the authors look at what is behind the decline in German export market shares and derive possible structural reforms.\\nWhat’s behind the sustained decline in German export market shares?\\n© aerial-drone / AdobeStock\\nJoachim Nagel: Target achieved, but challenges still remain\\n10.07.2025\\nMonetary policy must be reliable, but policymakers must not overly restrict its flexibility\\n, Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel said at the 10th Bundesbank\\nIAW\\nLecture in Tübingen.

The change in approach affords public members the ability to take part in their government while balancing the board’s need to conduct its business in a timely fashion.\\nWhat are the primary changes?\\nAt the beginning of each meeting there is an opportunity for the public to comment on matters which are not on the current meeting agenda. The board cannot act on or discuss items not on the current agenda. The board may direct staff to put an issue brought forward from the public on a future meeting agenda.\\nThe public may comment on an agenda item during the public comment period for each board action item. Each meeting agenda will reflect this time after the introduction of a topic. If there is no public comment, the chair or presiding officer may immediately close that item’s public comment period and proceed with the meeting. The chair or presiding officer may limit comments to proceed with the meeting as well. Once the public comment period is closed, the public may not provide further comment during the remainder of the agenda item discussion, unless specifically requested by the chair or presiding officer of the meeting. Written public comments may be submitted and are encouraged.\\nHow do I submit my public comments?\\nPlease submit your written public comment(s), related to an agenda item, no later than seven (7) days prior to a scheduled board meeting. In your comments, please include your first and last name, and what organization you are representing, if you are representing one. Please also specify what agenda item you are commenting on, or if it is a general comment for consideration. Keep your comments direct and detail the issue(s) you want to bring to the board’s attention. Comments unrelated to an agenda item may be submitted at any time and are encouraged.\\nWritten comments can be submitted by email either to the board’s executive officer or board specific inbox. Contact information is located\\nhere\\n; simply navigate to the appropriate board and scroll to the bottom of the webpage where contact information for each officer and inbox is located. If you have further questions, please reach out to the executive officer of the board you are interested in.\\nPlease see the Public Comment Guide and FAQ below for more specific details:\\nPublic Comment Guide\\nPublic Comment FAQ\\nLicense Information\\nRegulations\\nStatute/Rule Information\\nAdministrative Rules\\nStatutes\\nRule Notices\\nForms\\nServices / Links\\nContinuing Education\\nFAQ\\nMilitary Spouses\\nMontana\\nBoard of Physical Therapy Examiners\\nMilitary Spouses\\nMilitary Spouse Application Information\\nThe Montana Department of Labor & Industry, Employment Standards Division, is committed to supporting and assisting military members and their spouses obtain professional and occupational licenses. We are dedicated to helping military families work and live in the great State of Montana.\\nTo support professionally licensed military families, please find detailed information about the professional licensing process in the state of Montana and some tips on how to get licensed quickly.\\nStart Early\\n6/10/22\\nStart your application early and online. Our online applications are the quickest way to apply, ebiz.mt.gov/pol. It may take some time for our Application processors to review your applications, documents, verifications, and license requirements. Applying before you move to Montana will help ensure all of the requirements for licensure are met and your license can be issued before you begin working in Montana.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nHave all records separated and available\\n6/10/22\\nKeep licensing, education, employment, and other records handy, do not pack them away for the move. If you are moving, be sure to keep your important documents in an easy and convenient spot. If you are wondering what documentation, information, or requirements are needed for your desired Montana license, go to the board website, click on Forms tab on the left, click Licensing Application, and select which license you would like to apply for. A document will have all application and licensing requirements needed. Please reference the image below to help guide you.\\nIt is important to note that every licensing board’s website might look a little different.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nUse an active and accessible email address\\n6/10/22\\nAfter you apply online, please be sure to use an active and convenient email address and watch your email for communication from your application processing team. Our team communicates via email. Whenever you fill out your application, please use an email address that is easily accessible and active for you. A quick response time will aid in a faster licensing process.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nPartner with our Customer Service Section for help\\n6/10/22\\nWe want to make sure that military spouses and families get the help and support that they need. Our customer service support staff is prepared to help you through your application and licensing process. If you need assistance, or have any questions please call 406-444-6880, or you can email customer service staff at\\nDLIBSDHELP@MT.GOV\\n. In your call or email, please make sure to tell our customer service representatives that you are a military spouse. They will ensure that you get the answers and assistance you need.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nDisclose ALL states you are licensed in\\n6/10/22\\nFinally, we know that license verifications can be a time-consuming process. When applicable, our application processing team will help verify out-of-state licenses via online verification portals, if the verifying state has the information available. Please be sure to list the states that you\\nalready have an active professional license in.\\nThat information will help our application processing team verify your licenses, when possible. However, we understand that not every state is set up for online license verifications and they will have to be sent in the mail or through a formal request.\\nIf all other licensing requirements are met,\\nwe can issue a provisional license with a reservation of rights. This acts as an active, full license for 60 days. This allows the licensee to get to work, while we complete the license verification process.\\nLast Updated 6/10/22\\nContact Information\\n6/10/22\\nWe are looking forward to having you and your family in Montana!

It is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of catecholamines, hence plays a key role in the physiology of adrenergic neurons. Mutations in this gene have been associated with autosomal recessive Segawa syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene.

Some user-agents, such as screen readers, may present this description before the content itself.\\ncolspan\\nA non-negative integer value indicating how many columns the header cell spans or extends. The default value is\\n1\\n. User agents dismiss values higher than 1000 as incorrect, defaulting such values to\\n1\\n.\\nheaders\\nA list of space-separated strings corresponding to the\\nid\\nattributes of the\\n<th>\\nelements that provide the headers for this header cell.\\nrowspan\\nA non-negative integer value indicating how many rows the header cell spans or extends. The default value is\\n1\\n; if its value is set to\\n0\\n, the header cell will extend to the end of the table grouping section (\\n<thead>\\n,\\n<tbody>\\n,\\n<tfoot>\\n, even if implicitly defined), that the\\n<th>\\nbelongs to. Values higher than\\n65534\\nare clipped at\\n65534\\n.\\nscope\\nDefines the cells that the header (defined in the\\n<th>\\n) element relates to. Possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are:\\nrow\\n: the header relates to all cells of the row it belongs to;\\ncol\\n: the header relates to all cells of the column it belongs to;\\nrowgroup\\n: the header belongs to a rowgroup and relates to all of its cells;\\ncolgroup\\n: the header belongs to a colgroup and relates to all of its cells.\\nIf the\\nscope\\nattribute is not specified, or its value is not\\nrow\\n,\\ncol\\n,\\nrowgroup\\n, or\\ncolgroup\\n, then browsers automatically select the set of cells to which the header cell applies.\\nDeprecated attributes\\nThe following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.\\nalign\\nDeprecated\\nSpecifies the horizontal alignment of the header cell. The possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are\\nleft\\n,\\ncenter\\n,\\nright\\n,\\njustify\\n, and\\nchar\\n. When supported, the\\nchar\\nvalue aligns the textual content on the character defined in the\\nchar\\nattribute and the offset defined by the\\ncharoff\\nattribute. Use the\\ntext-align\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\naxis\\nDeprecated\\nContains a list of space-separated strings, each corresponding to the\\nid\\nattribute of a group of cells that the header cell applies to. Use the\\nscope\\nattribute instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nbgcolor\\nDeprecated\\nDefines the background color of the header cell. The value is an HTML color; either a\\n6-digit hexadecimal RGB code\\n, prefixed by a\\n#\\n, or a\\ncolor keyword\\n. Other CSS\\n<color>\\nvalues are not supported. Use the\\nbackground-color\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nchar\\nDeprecated\\nDoes nothing. It was originally intended to specify the alignment of the content to a character of the header cell. Typical values for this include a period (\\n.\\n) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If\\nalign\\nis not set to\\nchar\\n, this attribute is ignored.\\ncharoff\\nDeprecated\\nDoes nothing. It was originally intended to specify the number of characters to offset the header cell content from the alignment character specified by the\\nchar\\nattribute.\\nheight\\nDeprecated\\nDefines a recommended header cell height. Use the\\nheight\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nvalign\\nDeprecated\\nSpecifies the vertical alignment of the header cell. The possible\\nenumerated\\nvalues are\\nbaseline\\n,\\nbottom\\n,\\nmiddle\\n, and\\ntop\\n. Use the\\nvertical-align\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nwidth\\nDeprecated\\nDefines a recommended header cell width. Use the\\nwidth\\nCSS property instead, as this attribute is deprecated.\\nUsage notes\\nThe\\n<th>\\nmay only be used within a\\n<tr>\\nelement.\\nIn simple contexts, using the\\nscope\\nattribute on header cells (\\n<th>\\nelements) is redundant because\\nscope\\nis inferred. However, certain assistive technologies may fail to infer correctly, so specifying header scope may improve user experiences.\\nWhen using the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes to span header cells across multiple columns and rows, cells without these attributes defined (with a default value of\\n1\\n) are automatically fitted into free available spaces in the table structure that span 1x1 cells, as illustrated in the following figure:\\nNote:\\nThese attributes must not be used to overlap cells.\\nExamples\\nSee\\n<table>\\nfor a complete table example introducing common standards and best practices.\\nBasic column and row headers\\nThis example uses\\n<th>\\nelements to introduce column and row headers in a basic table structure.\\nHTML\\nThe first row (\\n<tr>\\nelement) contains the column headers (\\n<th>\\nelements), which act as \"titles\" for the columns to make it easier to understand the information in the columns and identify the data. To indicate that each column header relates to all cells in the corresponding column, the\\nscope\\nattribute is set to\\ncol\\n(column).\\nThe remaining rows contain the main data of the table. Each of these rows has a row header (\\n<th>\\nelement) introduced as the first cell. This creates a column with row headers as the first column of the table. Similar to the column headers, the\\nscope\\nattribute is set to\\nrow\\nto specify which cells each row header relates to, which in the example below are all data cells (\\n<td>\\nelements) in each\\nrow\\n.\\nNote:\\nNormally, the grouping elements\\n<thead>\\nand\\n<tbody>\\nare used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections.

In this way, the \"Pronunciation\" column is split into two columns, one for the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation and one for the respelling (the original pronunciation column). The corresponding data cells (\\n<td>\\nelements) are added to each subsequent row.\\nAs shown in the\\nusage notes\\n, the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes can be used for the\\n<th>\\nelements to allocate the header cells to the correct columns and rows. To achieve a \"two-row\" header in the table structure, the first two header cells within the first\\n<tr>\\nelement are spanned across two rows. The third header cell is spanned two columns wide (remaining in the first row). This setup leaves two available areas in the third and fourth columns in the second row, where the two headers within the second\\n<tr>\\nelement are automatically placed, with the default value being\\n1\\nfor the\\ncolspan\\nand\\nrowspan\\nattributes.\\nNote:\\nNormally,\\n<thead>\\nand\\n<tbody>\\nelements are used to group rows with headers into the respective table head and body sections.

Therefore, the\\nheaders\\nattribute is used on the \"Pronunciation\", \"IPA\", and \"Respelling\" header cells to associate the related header cells based on the values of the unique identifiers from the added\\nid\\nattributes in the form of a space-separated list.\\nNote:\\nIt\\'s recommended to use more descriptive and useful values for the\\nid\\nattribute.

(The phone works fine and has a decent camera for the $199 I paid Samsung after they took my 7 year old Motorola Atrix HD sitting in a drawer for $75 trade-in credit.\\xa0 IMO buying from Smasung with their constant sales is the way to go.)\\nI tried the Settings/Connections/More connections/Network Unlock/Permanent Unlock menu on my phone to no avail.\\xa0 I called TMobile 800 937 8997 who said their new policy requires phones to be purchased from TMobile to have eligibility for unlocking.\\nThey pointed to Samsung. I called Samsung at 800 726 7864 on my Google Voice on my Windows 11 Laptop\\xa0 and the helpful gentleman in the Dominican Republic said we need to get TMobile on the line. He connected with TMobile and when they answered I went through the robot menu of TMobile PIN and my phone number and declared what my call was for.\\xa0 When the lady from TMobile answered, the Samsung man indicated that Tmobile was needed to unlock my phone.\\xa0 She BTW, was in Charleston South Carolina and I am in New York. After some minutes, after verifying my identity and using her system in SC, she had me go through the same exact menu and this time it was Unlocked.I thanked both of them in the Dominican Republic and in South Carolina and me being in New York.\\xa0 Now I have the option to try other MVNO offers on TMobile compatible or other networks.\\nI am amazed this multi-party, multi-country free Google Voice phone call over VOIP from my laptop also worked.\\nRead more\\nShare\\nShare\\nNew to Reddit?\\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\\nContinue with Email\\nContinue With Phone Number\\nBy continuing, you agree to our\\nUser Agreement\\nand acknowledge that you understand the\\nPrivacy Policy\\n.\\nPublic\\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community\\nReddit Rules\\nPrivacy Policy\\nUser Agreement\\nAccessibility\\nReddit, Inc. © 2025.
